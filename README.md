# Edstem-Elite

Welcome! This is a Chrome Extension for Edstem (https://edstem.org).

At the moment, its only feature is to count the number of posts each staff member has given an answer to, but there are MANY, MANY other features planned. One main one is creating automated responses using GPT to questions, as well as Slack integration to give updates on questions answered.

Instructions to run (in dev mode):

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`

2. Enable developer mode in the top right

3. Click `Load unpacked` and select this directory

4. You're good to go! Try pinning the extension!
